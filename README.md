## Further help

.NET or Java or JavaScript
Using only core C# or Java or JavaScript language (no open-source libraries), write a method that takes in a file as input and returns true or false whether the contents of the file is a valid solution to a Sudoku puzzle. The solution should handle exception scenarios.

(You can create additional classes as necessary. Please keep all classes in same solution. Also include unit tests and test case files used.)
